    This project was built based on 2 different NASA APIs. In the first section of the project's page, 
    you'll have the ability to search for a picture based on a start date and an end date.
One of the challenges in building this section was that the APOD API provides pictures that are copyright 
protected so I had to filter them out by using mapping and filtering techniques.
The second section of my project uses the NASA Image and Video Library API that returns a more complex 
array of data. I also had to filter this array for copyrighted content which in this case I decided to simply 
filter the images out of the displayed selection. Both sections offer content details that you can access by 
clicking on the picture of your choice. Note that this project uses a DEMO_KEY so the number of API calls
 is very limited, about 30 calls per hour to a maximum of 50 calls per day per IP address. If you're having 
 trouble having your selected dates render, this could be a reason.
This project outlines my skills using APIs, mapping and filtering techniques, conditional rendering, 
useState, useEffect, Params, React Router, CSS Bootstrap framework, and use of local storage.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
